## Sequential Commands

#### Problem Statement:
Detecting sequential commands can be difficult, expecially when we apply some compute contraints. When I talk to something I really dont want to wait more than a second or two for a response.

__E.g.__
When a system is provided the following statement
"Add 52 to the low of San Francisco" intuitively as humans we know at a high level we really need to complete 2 tasks here, first we need to find the low of san francisco and second add 52 to that value.

#### Approach:
Ya.. just trying a couple ideas out here.. will come back to this with some findings. maybe..
